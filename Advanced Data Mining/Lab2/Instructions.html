</head><body><h2>TDDD41/732A75: Association Analysis -1</h2>

<h3>Goals</h3>

<ul>
<li>Cluster a given dataset and use association analysis to describe
the clusters obtained.
</li></ul>

<h3>Procedure</h3>

<ul>


<li><b> Dataset</b>

<p>
In this exercise, you will work with one of the most well-known datasets in the data mining
literature, namely the Iris dataset. The dataset consists of 50 samples from each of three
species of Iris flowers (Iris setosa, Iris virginica and Iris versicolor). Four features were measured from each sample, they are the length and the width of sepal and petal. You can find
the dataset <a href="https://www.ida.liu.se/~732A75/lab/iris.arff">here</a>.

</p><p>
Open the iris.arff file.
Since the association analysis in Weka (Apriori algorithm) cannot cope with continuous
attributes, we should discretize the iris dataset before starting the mining process. Weka
provides several filters to apply to the data. You can see them by pressing the <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Choose</b></font>
button. We are interested in the Discretize filter that you can find by selecting the directory
Unsupervised first and then the directory Attribute. Now, click on the line that has appeared
to the right of the Choose button to edit the properties of the filter. You can find a detailed
description of the filter by pressing the <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>More</b></font> button. Select the attributes indices 1-4 (meaning
that you do not want to discretize the 5th attribute as it is the class and thus already discrete)
and select 3 bins (number of states of the discretized attributes). Press <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OK</b></font>. Press <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Apply</b></font>.
Now you can edit the data again by pressing the <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Edit</b></font> button and see that the data has
actually been discretized.

</p></li><li><b>Clustering</b>

<p>
Appy SimpleKmeans clusterer to the data with 3 clusters (since we know
	      there are 3 types of Iris flowers) and seed value 10. In the Cluster mode, select Classes
to clusters evaluation to crosstabulate the clustering and class labeling.  Ignore the
class attribute. 


</p></li><li><b>Association analysis</b>
<p>
To perform association analysis, click on the <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Associate</b></font> tab. Press the <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Choose</b></font> button to select
the association algorithm (we recommend to use the Apriori algorithm). Click on the line
that has appeared to the right of the Choose button to edit the properties of the algorithm.
You can find a detailed description of the algorithm by pressing the <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>More</b></font> button. Set the
desired properties and press <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>OK</b></font>. Click <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Start</b></font>. Check the output on the right hand side of the
screen. Note that after the conjunctions of attribute-value pairs on the right and left hand
sides of each rule, there is a number. That number indicates the support of the determinant
and of the determinant plus the consequent.

</p></li><li><b>Visualization</b>
<p>
By clicking on the <font face="Verdana" size="2"><b> Visualize</b></font> tab, you can see the data crosstabulated for each pair of attributes.
Set your visualization preferences with the bars at the bottom of the screen.

</p></li><li><b>Describing clustering through association analysis</b>
<p>

Now we use association analysis to assist you in describing the clusters found in the Iris dataset.
The first thing to do is to create a new attribute that represents the cluster label assigned
to each instance. For this purpose, click on the Preprocess tab and select the AddCluster
filter (in the Attribute directory within the Unsupervised directory). Click on the line that
has appeared to the right of the Choose button to edit the properties of the filter, e.g. which
clustering algorithm to use, number of clusters (we recommend to use 3 clusters), ignored
attributes (ignore the class), etc. Check the section on clustering above if in doubt. Press
Apply. Check that a 6th attribute has been created with the clustering label.
Now, run the association analysis as indicated in the corresponding section above. Find
rules that are accurate and such that the antecedent does not contain the class attribute and
the consequent only contains the cluster attribute. Find such rules for the 3 clusters. This
should help you to describe the instances grouped in each cluster.
Repeat the exercise above with a different combination of clustering algorithm, number
of clusters and/or number of bins in the discretization filter, in order to see whether you get
better or worse results.

<h3>Submission</h3>

<p>
Submit a report on your experiments and results as well as answers to all questions in the text. In addition to the experiment described in the text (3 clusters, 3 bins) your report should include discussion about at least two out of 3 possible varitions. 
</p><ul>
  <li>Different clustering algorithm (avoid using MakeDensityBasedCluster wrapper in this case)</li>
  <li>Different number of clusters</li>
  <li>Different number of bins</li>
</ul>
When running experiments with different variations, make sure you reload the data and reapply the AddCluster filter. In each of the 3 (or 4) experiments you should identify at least one (possibly the best) association rule for each of the clusters (<b>Hint</b>: numOfRules parameter). In addition, try to explain the differences between results in different experiments as well as reasons for why these differences occured. 

<p>
When explaining the experiments there is no need for explaining every step of the process (such as which buttons were clicked, etc). It is enough to say which algorithm was run and which arguements were used. In addition, do not copy-paste the full outputs from the tool. When presenting the results, present only those parts of the output which are relevant for what you are trying to explain. Avoid writing statements without motivation, such as "Results are better/worse." In other words, explain in what respect they are better/worse and why this happened.
